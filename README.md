It's a simple CRUD app with a single-page user facing front-end. The Admin area, for all CRUD actions, is behind a login (Devise).  It is fully responisve, although, the Admin area is best accessed on a tablet or desktop. There really shouldn't be any admin actions done on phones, but you are 100% capable if absolutely needed.
