#Board Prep

This is a simple CRUD app that helps co-workers learn the names of our Board Members.

* Built on Ruby 2.0 and Rails 4.1.

* It uses [*MixItUp*](https://mixitup.kunkalabs.com) from KunkaLabs Limited, for the shuffle and sorting features.

* It will use [*Devise*](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) for admin purposes.
